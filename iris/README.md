### Usage:  [![alt text](http://metaware.us/iris/images/info.png "Info Icon")](http://metaware.us/iris/images/iris_window.png)

<sub>_The application will prompt for an API Key, which IRIS will guide you to do. Just click on the "Get API" button, and copy the API Key into IRIS once obtained._</sub>

In general, using IRIS requires opening "Input Windows" and "Output Windows", and connecting them.
* **Input Windows** - allow you to enter either terms, expressions or full-bodied text. The first Input Window opened automatically opens an Output Window and connects it. For others, you must open and [connect them manually.](http://metaware.us/iris/images/input_selector.png)

* **Output Windows** - [show progress](http://metaware.us/iris/progress.html) of all queries, and display the results in many different ways. Select on the various tabs in order to see the different output formats.

**For Tips:** _click on [![alt text](http://metaware.us/iris/images/info.png "Info Icon")](http://metaware.us/iris/images/iris_window.png)_, available throughout **IRIS**.

### "Expressions" Tab

1. Don't enter in any "operators" (i.e. AND, OR, XOR etc.) 
2. Just enter word after word and in-between the UI will prompt for the operators... 
3. Use the "arrow" keys to cycle through the operator choices... 

**General Cursor Movement** 

* In general, use the arrow keys to move the cursor in-between the terms, and "tab/shift-tab" to move to each term.
* Use the **"ctrl"** key to select words or enter parenthesis between words once the cursor is moved.
